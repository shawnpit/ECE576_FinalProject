# ECE576_FinalProject

For this project I create a Huffman Coding algorithm using the python programming language. The file "HuffmanCode.py" contains the source code.

I developed a GUI (HuffmanCode.exe) that contains two press buttons. 

-The first button is labeled "Browse a file to Encode". This button is used to encode a file, any file format is acceptable. Two files will be generated after the file is selected. One file will be a .bin file which is the encoded file. The other file is a HuffmanReport.txt file which contains information of encoding process.

-The second button is labeled "Browse a file to Decode". This button is used to decode the .bin file that is generated from the first button. Afterwards a new file will be generated that is identical to the original file that was encoded.  

Reference "Huffman Coding Algorithm.pptx" for additional information on the Huffman Coding Algorithm. 

Note: This program crashes for files over a 1GB.
